Code and documentation on how to apply a Tikhonov regularization

=======

A Tikhonov regularization is used to approximate given data points by a smooth curve (regularization.m) or a smooth surface (regularization2D.m).
The codes work with Octave. Examples are generated by "demo regularization" and "demo regularization2D".

The file RegularizationReport.pdf contains an extensive documentation of the code, examples and the mathematical background.
